######## 1) Function to read .root files containing a single channels######

def ReadRootSingleCOMPASS(name):

    """
This function is to read .root data from COMPASS (filtered data, which is the 
one  with the good data) if storing each channel in a single .root.
.root better than .csv because it is approx an order of magnitude lighter 
(10MB vs 100MB). Note that to obtain the wave, each channel have to be saved
in a .root, and the .root weights an order of magnitude more (8MB vs 200kB)

*Inputs:
        .name = filename in string format, eg: 
                'DataF_CH14@V1725S_646_run.root'
        
*Outputs:
        .Channel = channel of the peak in the histogram
        .Board channel = board channel, the ch of the digitizer used (usually 15)
        .waveform = vector data with the waveform in strange units.
	.time = vector data for the waveform plot
	.Flags, Timestamp = vectors given by the.root, but useless for us
        .n_events = number of events of each hist

#There is a simple function called AsMatrix, but since it will be removed,

#How to get the waveform (fArray)? Seeing the TBrwoser, it has n*1000 entries, which would
#mean that for each event, it stores 1000 numbers (1000=fN). I can not store all the
#n*1000 entries becasue the pc takes too long, so will only store the 1000 numbers
#for a single event, the last. This would is simply mean using the variable event,
# since it will contain the last iteration of the previous loop, and save the values.
#Note that:
	#- size(event.Samples.fArray)>= n*1000, so that each event has more than 1000 values,
	#  which is extremely range and do not match the hypothesis explained above. 
	#  If choosing the 1st thousand values, from 0 to 1000, the
	#  waveform is obtained, while if choosing other range, say from 1000 to 2000, etc, 
	#  weird results are obtained. Chosssing the value number n*1000 breaks spyder.
