### 1) Function to read .root files containing a single channel (waveform included) ###
####################################################################


def ReadRootSingleCOMPASS(name, Waveform_saving = False):

    """
This function is to read .root data from COMPASS (filtered data, which is the 
one  with the good data) if 
	i) storing each channel in a single .root.
	ii) a single .root for all channels, but loading the file with a Tree 

Those files contains a Tree, with leafs and a TArrayS with the waveform

.root better than .csv because it is approx an order of magnitude lighter 
(10MB vs 100MB). Note that to obtain the wave, each channel have to be saved
in a .root, and the .root weights an order of magnitude more (8MB vs 200kB)

The data can be readed in 2 ways, using a function that will be removed called 
AsMatrix(), which is very fast (comparable to C++), and the other way, which
is the one found in the bilbio (example). The first takes about 0.5s, and the 
0ther 50s ==> 10 times shorter. So, will use it as long as it exists. When it
ceases to exist, the funciton automatically will sswitch to the other (try
    except blocks)

*Inputs:
        .name = filename in string format, eg: 
                'DataF_CH14@V1725S_646_run.root' / 'SDataF_run.root'
                                                    (S from time sorted)
        .Waveform_saving = if True, the outputs return the waveform. Default
            value = False
        
*Outputs:
        .A dictionary with 2 dafaframes:
            .Dataframe with:
                -Channel = channel of the peak in the histogram
                -Board channel = board channel, the ch of the digitizer used (usually 15)
                -Flags, Timestamp = vectors given by the.root, but useless for us
            .Dataframe with:  ONLY IF WAVEFORM_SAVING = TRUE
                - waveform = vector data with the waveform in strange units.
                -time = vector data for the waveform plot
        .Plot (python) of the 1D spectra and the 2D spectrum. Root plot, TH2F
                    computed but not plotted because it slows down a lot the PC
                    to play with that plot

is this function just in case :))


.root better than .csv because it is approx an order of magnitude lighter

    """
This function is to make coincidences between 2 channels of MARS. It needs the
data from a single .root containng all the channels Time sorted, i.e., to load the
file 'SDataF_run.root'.

To do the coincidence, event by event, have to:
    1) Choose an event
    2) Check if the next one is from the other Channel or not
    3) If yes, coincidences are possible. Check if the time interval
           betweeen those events are small enough.
    4) Store the single energy values if the time interval is small enough,
            which will be the coincidences energies
            
The time interval to compare with its the gate, since once the gate is opened, 
the ADC records signals, so that, if the time interval between 2 measurements is
greater than the gate, those measurements were taken with 2 different gates and not
the same, and hence they are not in coincidence. Counterwise, if for a single gate
2 measurements were taken, those measurements are in coincidence.

@WATCH OUT:
    .To do the comparisons, I choose one event, and then I compare it with the next one,
        and I vary the original event. So, say event 1 is in coincidence with event 2.
        In the nex loop, it will choose event 2 and try t compare it with event 3.
        They won't be in coincidence, event 3 is from another gate (remember the gate
        is optimized to fit tightly the wave to avoid piling up events).
