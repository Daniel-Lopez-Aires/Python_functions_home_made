This function is to read .root data from COMPASS (filtered data, which is the one 
with the good data), in order to capture the wave, or what we think it should be 
the wave. .root better than .csv because it is approx an order of magnitude lighter
(10MB vs 100MB)

*Inputs:
        .name = filename in string format, eg: 'blablabla.root'
        
*Outputs:
        .Channel = channel of the peak in the histogram
        .Board channel = board channel, the ch of the digitizer used (usually 15)
        .waveform = vector data with the waveform in strange units.
	.time = vector data for the waveform plot
	.Flags, Timestamp = vectors given by the.root, but useless for us

#To import things from ROOT, previously you have to source thisroot.sh from 
    #the  command line! So, before opening anaconda to open spyder, you must do:
                #cd root/bin
                #source thisroot.sh

#Whatch out, that Tree contains leaves (Energy, Sample, etc), but it also

#There is a simple function called AsMatrix, but since it will be removed,
#will not use it. eg of that function:
        #E = Tree.AsMatrix(columns=["Energy"])
#Other version to read the values , similar to the one used in C== is:
    
    E = np.array( [] )                    #store the Energy
    board = np.array( [] )                #store the Board
    ch_digi = np.array( [] )              #store the Channel
    timestamp = np.array( [] )            #store the Timestamp
    flags = np.array( [] )      #store the flags
    fN = np.array( [] )         #store fn, the number of points
                #of the waveform
    waveform = np.array( [] )    #store of the waveform 
               
    for event in tree:  #for each event, store the desired values
        E = np.append(E, tree.Energy) 
        board = np.append(board, tree.Board)
        ch_digi = np.append(ch_digi, tree.Channel)

        flags = np.append(flags, tree.Flags)
        fN = np.append(fN, tree.Samples.fN)

#I will not loop through all the event because it will give 7321000 numbers,
#which is too much, and the pc takes a lot, so will choose the last event, which
#is simply using the variable event, since it will contain the last iteration of the
#previous loop. 


    for i in range(0,int(fN[-1]) ): #i goes from 0 to 1000=fN[j], for all j
        waveform = np.append(waveform,event.Samples.fArray[i])      
        #print(event.Samples.fArray[i])     
    

 # for elem in event.Samples.fArray: #for last event of the previous loop
 #        print(elem)
 #        Waveform = np.append(Waveform, elem)
#This loop do not end!!!  


    #the x axis for the waveform plot is determined by the ADC sampling time, which
    #is 4ns in our case [CAEN's COMPASS manual], so the X data will then be (the Y data
    #is the sample):      
    time = np.linspace(0, int(fN[-1])*4, int(fN[-1]) )          #[ns] time for
            #the waveform sample

   #the values will be returned in a dictionary indicating what is each
   #value
    values = {'Board_ch' : board, 'E (ch)' : E,
