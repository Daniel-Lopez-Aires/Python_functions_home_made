######## 1) Function to read .root files containing a single channels######
####################################################################


def ReadRootSingleCOMPASS(name):

    """
This function is to read .root data from COMPASS (filtered data, which is the 
one  with the good data) if storing each channel in a single .root.
.root better than .csv because it is approx an order of magnitude lighter 
(10MB vs 100MB). Note that to obtain the wave, each channel have to be saved
in a .root, and the .root weights an order of magnitude more (8MB vs 200kB)

*Inputs:
        .name = filename in string format, eg: 
                'DataF_CH14@V1725S_646_run.root'
        
*Outputs:
        .Channel = channel of the peak in the histogram
        .Board channel = board channel, the ch of the digitizer used (usually 15)
        .waveform = vector data with the waveform in strange units.
	.time = vector data for the waveform plot
	.Flags, Timestamp = vectors given by the.root, but useless for us
